Why did I make this project?
----------------------------
- This is my first responsive website! I always wanted to learn and build a fully-responsive website.
- Bootstrap makes it very easy to create fluid containers, beautify existing HTML elements and add animations.

What is this?
-------------
- This is a simple static website built only using HTML + CSS + Bootstrap. 
- While working on this website I learned how to create responsive websites.
